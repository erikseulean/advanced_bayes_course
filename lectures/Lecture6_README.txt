In this lecture we will discuss informative priors and
how to summarise posterior distributions (a topic we will complete
in Lecture 7).

There are no slides for the first part of lecture 6 but I will
follow Section 1.4.2 of the Lecture notes.

The second part refers to Section 1.5.1 "Point Estimates" and is
also included in the slides for Lecture 7 uploaded in the relative
folder.
