#' Sequentially generate draws from a Dirichlet process mixture model,
#' by showing step by step the iterations taken.
#' The plot is centered at 0, with x and y from -5 to 5.
#' The mixture draws the centres for clusters from a Normal distribution
#' with mean mu and standard deviation sigma_0
#'
#' Hit enter to keep drawing until max n, type x to exit.
#' @param n Number of observations.
#' @param alpha Alpha corresponding to GEM(alpha) used to draw the rho vector.
#' @param mu Mean of the Normal distribution used to draw the clusters.
#' @param sigma_0 Standard deviation of the Normal distribution used
#' to draw the points around the cluster centre.
#' @return Returns the n observations sampled from the DPMM distribution.
